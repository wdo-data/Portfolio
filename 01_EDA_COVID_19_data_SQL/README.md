# SQL, COVID-19 Exploratory Data-Analysis-Project:

In this project, I explored a COVID-19 dataset by performing queries to gain insights on the number of cases, deaths and vaccinations around the world in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. This project was done to showcase some of my SQL skills, the queries were then extracted to create a dashboard in Tableau.
